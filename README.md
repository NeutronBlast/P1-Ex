# Exercises
This repository contains the following exercises

1. **Combine two words**: The program will ask the user to input text 1 and text 2 and it will return a combination between the words letter by letter, for instance

Let *word 1* be house and *word 2* be music, the output will be: *hmouussiec*

2. **Sum the digits consecutively**: For instance, given the number 789 the program will work in the following way:

7+8+9 = 24


2+4 = 6

*Output*: 6

3. **Break down a number**: Given the number 789 the output of the program will be like this:

7

78

789


4. **Common digits**: Given two numbers print a third one with the common digits between the first and the second number. Example: Given 721 and 717 the output of the program will be: 71. Do not repeat the numbers in the generated one.

5. **Crypting**: Given a word encode it at n positions forward in the alphabet. Example: Given the word hello and n = 2 the output of the program should be *jfnnq*, with the same word and n = 1 the output would be *ifmmp*

6. **One dimension array average and maximum**: Fill an one dimension array of 4 elements and calculate the average and the maximum value of it

7. **Transposed matrix**: Given a matrix (2 dimension array) calculate its transposed. Example, given this matrix:

| 55 | 18 | 84 |

| 24 | 12 | 19 |

| 78 | 90 | 42 |

The output of the program should be:

| 55 | 24 | 78 |

| 18 | 12 | 90 |

| 84 | 19 | 42 |

8. **Triangular matrix**: Given a square matrix (same number of rows and columns) the program must tell if a matrix is triangular or not. Remember that a matrix is triangular above or under its main diagonal are zeros

9. **Min number**: Given a matrix calculate the minimum value

10. **Matrix multiplication**

11. **Sorting**: Given an unidimensional array leave the even numbers at the beginning and the odd numbers at the end (same order they appear)
