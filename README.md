# Exercises
This repository contains the following exercises

1. **Combine two words**: The program will ask the user to input text 1 and text 2 and it will return a combination between the words letter by letter, for instance

Let *word 1* be house and *word 2* be music, the output will be: *hmouussiec*

2. **Sum the digits consecutively**: For instance, given the number 789 the program will work in the following way:

7+8+9 = 24


2+4 = 6

*Output*: 6

3. **Break down a number**: Given the number 789 the output of the program will be like this:

7

78

789


4. **Common digits**: Given two numbers print a third one with the common digits between the first and the second number. Example: Given 721 and 717 the output of the program will be: 71. Do not repeat the numbers in the generated one.

5. **Crypting**: Given a word encode it at n positions forward in the alphabet. Example: Given the word hello and n = 2 the output of the program should be *jfnnq*, with the same word and n = 1 the output would be *ifmmp*
